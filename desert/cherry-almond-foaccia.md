Directions

1. Thaw dough according to package directions. Cut each roll into 4 pieces. Arrange pieces about 1/2 inch apart on a greased 12-inch pizza pan or 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Gently press pieces together to form a crust. Toss cherries with 1/4 cup of the powdered sugar; spoon over crust. Top with almonds and granola. Cover; let rise in a warm place 1 hour.

2. Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until center is done, covering with foil the last 10 minutes, if necessary. Cool on a rack 10 minutes. Combine icing packets, remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar, milk, and extract; drizzle over bread. Makes 12 to 16 servings.
